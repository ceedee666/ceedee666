### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a [Professor of Information Systems](https://www.fh-aachen.de/menschen/drumm) at the [University of Applied Sciences](https://www.fh-aachen.de/) in Aachen. I'm also a [SAP Champion](https://community.sap.com/programs/influencer-programs/champions) and Member of the [SAP DACH Academic Board DACH](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/04/06/sap-academic-board-dach/).
    
Together with [Damir](https://github.com/damir-majer) I founded the ABAP CodeRetreat to bring the idea of [code retreats](https://www.coderetreat.org/) into the SAP community.
